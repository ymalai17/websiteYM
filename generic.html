								   <h1>The Story of<br />
									Yash Malai</h1>
									<p>Originally born in Tamil Nadu, India, my family and I came to the United States in search of a brighter future.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/IMG-2224.JPG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Growing up, I was a huge fan of American football and basketball. Of course being from Boston, I am a die-hard Patriots and Celtics fan. What I truly loved about the sport was tracking statistics of the players, which is something I still do today. I did my undergraduate studies at Stonehill College, where I studied neuroscience. I was curious to understand on a deeper level how the brain works, and I intended to become a neurosurgeon, in order to cure CTE, a common traumatic brain injury found in athletes. However, I switched careers and have taken an interest in data science, mainly machine learning, due to the advancement of statistics and predictive analytics in sports. I aim to head my own sports statistics-tracking company within the next five years, and I have the talent to do so.</p>
								<p>  I wanted to become a neurosurgeon, because I was fascinated with the human mind and how it works. Ultimately, that goal didn’t work out, but I found a different passion: data science. During my time at Tufts and in Merrimack, I developed an understanding of data, ranging from simple inputs to predictive modelling. This is where I started learning many R techniques, such as RShiny, GGplot, and used data visualization tools like Tableau. Later, I wanted to learn about the business side of data analytics, so I joined Babson College to get a degree in business analytics. This is where my programming abilities really started to take shape, as I got an extensive look into what machine learning’s impact on the world can truly be. I further sharpened my skills in R and Python, learning machine learning methods in both languages. I also had a major improvement in skill with Tableau, from learning about level of details, to sets/groups/hierarchies. I can easily create anything from line charts to geospatial plots. In Python, I have developed a strong understanding of pandas, and can create an effective web scraper, thanks to my experience working with a client in Babson. In the future, I want to start my own data analytics company one day, creating an optimized model that can accurately predict how well a football or basketball player can perform based on a multitude of variables: weather, if it’s a home/away game, strength of defense, strength of offense, and more. What I lack in experience, I more than make up for in talent, passion, and commitment. I would love to get my career started in the world of data science as soon as possible. </p>
